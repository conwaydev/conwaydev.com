> Greenhouse is an applicant tracking system and recruiting software designed to optimize your entire recruiting process. Find better candidates, conduct more focused interviews, and make data-driven hiring decisions.

Sometimes I think that hiring software is a super saturated market. I see companies like Lever, Jazz, Yello, and hundreds of others in the space and I can’t help but think “Why would you try to start to a recruiting software company?”. Granted all of the companies mentioned do an excellent job and serve the needs of their customers, but I want to speak from a developers point of view as to why I feel like Greenhouse is the best.

## 1. Their API docs are awesome

As a developer working with any third party service you’ll know that not all services keep an up to date docs, if they even have docs at all. Greenhouse are utilizing a generator called [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate) that just looks fantastic and above all helps me find exactly what I’m looking for. You can find Greenhouse’s docs [here](https://developers.greenhouse.io/job-board.html).

## 2. You can just use their Job Board API anywhere

This to me is the kicker, in that their Job Board API allows for a fully customizable experience. Before getting the chance to use Greenhouse, I had been working on customizing [JazzHR](https://www.jazzhr.com/) career pages. Now JazzHR has a wonderful backend and a great administrative experience, but at the end of the day you’re adding CSS to their templates they’ve already made, not allowing any customization. With Greenhouse’s free-for-all Job Board API you can create a specific job board experience tailored to your company. With a company like Sprout Social who truly value the candidate experience, it was a must have to not necessary have a stock approach like companies such as JazzHR and Lever.

Another big side of their open-ended API is that prototyping is actually a possibility. Here’s an example of something I was able to whip up in minutes without it needing to live in our code base to show an experience where a user can filter jobs by location. This may also be a good time to mention that Sprout Social is [hiring](https://sproutsocial.com/careers/open-positions/#/)!

The ability to simply show a list of jobs and their attributes on any web property is a super useful feature. All that said I think that Greenhouse have done a wonderful job with the ability of customization and creating solid API docs to help developers build out awesome experiences.
