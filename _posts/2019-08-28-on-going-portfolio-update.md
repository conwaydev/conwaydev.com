description: Why can’t I just write a blog without reinventing the universe?
---
I don’t know where it comes from, but any time I think “I should blog about that” it’s quickly followed by, “I should actually redo my entire portfolio, finally add case studies, and use a completely different technology stack”. I feel like I’m not alone in that sentiment and its SO unnecessary, but it’s there.

Well I’m going to do something about, and that something is blogging about me transforming the portfolio. There are so many cool and interesting technologies in the front-end space now that I think its high time I start playing around with them. Theres a ton of decisions to make along the way but I’m going to start with creating an actual CMS rather than markdown files. 

## A CMS will make me write blog posts right?

I’ve been meaning to look into [Netifly CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). In my mind, creating a space to write thats not in code will ideally inspire me to write more. Now this is unlikely, but right now I’m feeling it. So thats what I did!

I went ahead and integrated Netifly with my existing set up on GitHub pages. My next steps are definitely going to start migrating the actual “hosting” to Netifly because if how AWESOME the tooling is, but this is the first step.

## Do I have an “End Goal”?

Not _really_, but I would like a fancier stack, and a place for me to just _write_, not look at the code that supports this portfolio. There are some things I’d definitely like to accomplish:

* Use either Gatsby or Eleventy as a static site generator
  * This site is currently Jekyll based which is great, but I want to use the cool new stuff!
*
