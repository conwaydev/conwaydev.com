                <h2>Metallica</h2>

                <p>
                    My last project I got to work on at StageBloc was Metallica's website, specifically creating components that we would use throughout the entire website. While working at StageBloc I had the opportunity to work on many large-scale projects, but Metallica was easily the largest.

                <p>
                    Before we started the project we realized that creating a components library was a necessity in order to make sure that the website could remain consistent in design. It was our first time creating a components library for a theme, but ended up proving very beneficial, not just for the scalability for development, but also making it easier to work with our designer and stakeholders.

                <p>
                    Insights is the <a href="//sproutsocial.com/insights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sprout Social WordPress blog</a> where content creators are able to share industry knowledge of Social Media as well as product announcements for the platform. Insights had been around for years before I started at Sprout Social, and like many WordPress sites had gone through a lot of iterations within the same theme. When talks of a redesign came around I was quick to make a case for a complete redevelopment of the theme. I wanted to make sure that we could create a WordPress theme that would be maintainable by several developers, as well as performance optimized for readers. The end result was a significant improvement in code quality, maintainability, as well as overall web performance.
