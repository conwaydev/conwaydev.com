                <h2>Sprout Social Insights</h2>

                <p>
                    Insights is the <a href="//sproutsocial.com/insights/">Sprout Social WordPress blog</a> where content creators are able to share industry knowledge of Social Media as well as product announcements for the platform. Insights had been around for years before I started at Sprout Social, and like many WordPress sites had gone through a lot of iterations within the same theme. When talks of a redesign came around I was quick to make a case for a complete redevelopment of the theme. I wanted to make sure that we could create a WordPress theme that would be maintainable by several developers, as well as performance optimized for readers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the development was wrapped up we ran performance metrics and saw that the redevelopment was able to reduce the page load for the blog index from an average of 3-5 seconds to <strong>100 milliseconds</strong>. The redevelopment reduced the network requests by <strong>65%</strong>, and reduced the page, stylesheet, and script sizes dramatically. The performance benefit, along with better SEO practices showed a substantial benefit as far as our Google crawls were concerned and an overwhelming praise from our readers.

                <p>
                    My last project I got to work on at StageBloc was Metallica's website, specifically creating patterns that we would use throughout the entire website. When working at StageBloc I had the opportunity to work on many large-scale projects, but Metallica was easily the largest.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before we started the project we realized that creating a pattern library was a necessity in order to make sure that the website could remain consistent in design. It was our first time creating a pattern library for a theme, but ended up proving very beneficial, not just for the scalability for development, but also making it easier to work with our designer and stakeholders.
