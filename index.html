                <p>Insights is <a href="//sproutsocial.com/insights/">Sprout Social's</a> WordPress blog where content creators are able to create thought leadership pieces on industry best practices in social media. Before I started at Sprout Social, Insights had gone through 2 different themes and had amassed a large amount of technical debt along the way. I was able to make the case for a complete retheming, from the ground up in order to increase performance as well as making it easier for new developers to get up to speed with the codebase.</p>

                <p>The last project I worked on before leaving StageBloc was Metallica's website, specifically creating reusable components to be shared throughout the site. Before this project we had used a styleguide internally for the product, but never for any customer themes, this was a great opportunity to create one, especially considering how large the site is.</p>

                <p>
                    As a developer who has worked at an agency I've built countless "Store Locators" using the Google Maps API, but when talking with Midopt about their needs I realized that this would be an excellent use case for integrating React with their WordPress by way of the WordPress REST API. I was fortunate enough to be able to use newer technologies to solve their needs and was able to bring some of their tech up to date.
